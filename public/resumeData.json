    "bio":"I am an athlete by heart and live to continuously improve myself whether it be strength or wisdom. I beleive anything can be acheived not through hard work alone, but consistent and disciplined work. Everyday I like to spend at least an hour outside, as one would find me either in the gym or out on the pitch playing soccer. I like to keep my lifestyle active although I do spend many hours on the computer.",
